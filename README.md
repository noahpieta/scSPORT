__scSPORTs__: a Single-cell RNA Structure Probing Method

## Introduction

RNA structure is critical for multiple steps in gene regulation. However, how structures of transcripts differ both within and between individual cells is unknown. Here, we develop __scSPORTs__, a method enabling the simultaneous determination of transcript structure and abundance at single-cell resolution, that opens the door to the systematic characterization of RNA structure-function relationships at single-cell resolution.
